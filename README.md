# Mining-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning

In this hands-on project, we will train machine learning and deep learning models to predict the percentage of Sillica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrateper minute.This project could be practically used in the mining industry to get the %Sillica Concentrate at much faster rate compared to traditional methods.
